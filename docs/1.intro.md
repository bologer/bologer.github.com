# Get Started

## Goal 
You may say that this is yet another documentation generation project. Yes it is, but it is much simpler and 
lightweight then what you've seen before.

I find it very frustrating to have so many versions of tools to build great documentation, but all of them are 
difficult to use, SaaS projects, lack functionallity, etc. 

What do we care the most when we write documentation? 

- you want it to be easily readable
- you want to have code highlighting
- you want it to looks good (visually)

Alright, writing is already hard, but why do you have to care about the rest?

So I decided to create this project to simplify the process of writing documentation. So developer, can focus on 
writing good documentation and this tool to do the rest. 

The idea is that you use this as a library, configure it to you needs and use a CLI tool to build documentation. 

You can easily pack generated content and put it to public domain.
