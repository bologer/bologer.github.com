# Hierarchy

The main idea is that you need to prefix your files to ensure correct ordering. 

The prefix can be anything, you can prefix it as `1.` or `1-` or `1.1.1`.

Let's see the following example: 
```
2. intro.md
1. other-file.md
```

The list of files above would produce the following order:

```
1. other-file.html
2. intro.html
```

Notice how `other-file.md` moved to the top of the list as it had `1.` which is smaller then `2.`.
