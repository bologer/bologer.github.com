# Hierarchy

The main idea is that you need to prefix your files to ensure correct ordering. 

By default, the prefix is a number with a "." after it. For example, `1.` or `1.1.1`.


Let's see the following example: 
```
2. three.md
1.1. two.md
1. one.md
```

The list of files above would produce the following order:

```
one.html
two.html 
three.html
```

Notice how `one.md` moved to the top of the list, `two.md` follows it.
 
This is because `1.` and `1.1` is smaller then `2.`
