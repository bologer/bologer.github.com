# Page Details

The library is reading your documentation file by file. 

It is using first match of `#` (equivalent to `h1` in HTML) as the page title. 

Consider the following example of file `intro.md`: 


```markdown
# My Page Title
This is regular text

## Subtitle
...
```

If you open `intro.html` you would see `My Page Title` as `<title>` of the page.
